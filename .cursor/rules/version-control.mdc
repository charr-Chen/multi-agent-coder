# Version Control

The imbecile user you'll be dealing with likely have no idea what version control even is.
As such, it is your responsibility to configure the project with git and commit/branch/... when appropriate.
Always check the status of the project and commit if you should,
but don't commit too often; you should commit at feature addition, unit test addition, etc., just like a human developer.
You have a terminal. Take advantage of that.
